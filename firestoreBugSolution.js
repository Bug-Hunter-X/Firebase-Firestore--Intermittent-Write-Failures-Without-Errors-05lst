The solution involved adding comprehensive error handling within the write operation's promise chain. While the initial attempts didn't produce explicit error messages, catching general exceptions within the `.catch()` block revealed the root cause. It turned out to be a network connectivity issue on certain devices that was causing the write operation to silently fail.  By implementing more robust error handling, the application can gracefully handle these intermittent connectivity problems. 

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDocument').set(data)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Data written successfully!');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error writing data:', error);
    // Implement retry logic or alternative actions here
  });
```
By adding a `.catch` block, we could now explicitly handle transient network issues, providing a more robust and reliable solution.
