# Firebase Firestore Intermittent Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered with Firebase Firestore where write operations would intermittently fail without throwing any errors. This occurred randomly, only affecting specific devices. The problem was particularly difficult to diagnose due to the lack of error messages or logs indicating a failure.

The `firestoreBug.js` file contains the original code that exhibited the issue. `firestoreBugSolution.js` provides the solution that resolved the issue.  Please see the detailed explanation in the bug report.
